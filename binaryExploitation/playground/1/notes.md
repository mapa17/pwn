# Fuzzing
Fuzzing with 200 pattern of first program arguments, overwrites stack in `sym.vuln`.
rbp at leave has the value `0x3761413661413561`, that is translated to an offset of 16.
So we expect rip to be rsp+16+8, so an ofset of 24.

# Target function
We have shell calling function in the code, located at: `0x004001ebd`.
Thats what we want to get into ip when sym.vuln returns.
